            <h1>IT COMPANIES</h1>
            <p>IT companies are responsible for making sure that operations are running the way they should. ...
                 IT is also responsible for installing new software, hardware and providing technical support. 
                 As a whole, IT assists with device, software and data management across the entire organization that 
                 they're working with.
            </p>
            <p>Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all 
                kinds of electronic data and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations 
                as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and
                communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information
                system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, 
                software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT users.

                 Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in 
                 Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC. However, the term information technology in its modern sense
                first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and 
                Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. 
                We shall call it information technology (IT)." Their definition consists of three categories: techniques 
                for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation
                of higher-order thinking through computer programs.The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and  computer
                networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones.
                Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer
                hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.
